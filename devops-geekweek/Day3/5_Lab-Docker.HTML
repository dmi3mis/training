      # Lab Docker

      # Installing

      Prerequisites:
      * Make sure you have a 64bit OS

      On Windows:
      * Windows 10: you may use Docker for windows (need to enable Hyper-V, beware this may interfere with Virtualbox in some setups)
      * Windows 7: Use [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/toolbox)
      
      **NOTE:** we suggest to use Docker toolbox if you are already using Virtualbox
      ---
      # Installing On Mac
      
      * Docker for Mac: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/mac/

      ---

      #Docker info
      First off we want to have a look at the Docker installation information, so run:
      
      ```
      $ docker info
      ```

      This command displays many information: how many images we have downloaded,  how many containers we have running, version of Docker etc.

      ---

      #Launching your first container

      Type:
      ```
      docker run ubuntu /bin/echo 'Hello world'
      ```

      * *docker run* runs a container
      * ubuntu is the image (pulled from Docker Hub as this is the first time you used it)
      * /bin/echo is the command that the container executes

      ---

      #Docker ps

      Docker ps displays running containers

      Type:
      ```
      docker ps
      ```

      * Do you see any container running
      * Why?

      ---

      #Launch a demonized container
      Let's start a container that will last longer

      Type:
      ```
      docker run -d ubuntu /bin/sh -c "while true; do echo hello world; sleep 1; done"
      ```

      * Test to see if the container is running with docker ps
      * Examine its logs using the command 'docker logs' (you'll need its name..)
      * Kill the container with 'docker stop' (you'll need its name..)

      ---

      #Operating inside a container

      Type:
      ```
      docker run -i -t ubuntu /bin/bash
      ```

      * Has your shell changed?
      * what outputs do you get with `ls -la` or `ifconfig`?

      `CTRL-d` exits the shell and shuts down the container. If you want to detach from it (while keeping the container running but ) use `CTRL-p CTRL-q`

      ---
      # Running a simple web server 
      
      ```
      docker run -d -p 80 tutum/hello-world
      ```
      * Test to see if the container is up and running with docker ps
      * Are there additional information here? 
      * Can you figure out the port (-p) command?
      
      ---
      # More Networking ;)
      
      * Can you launch the previous command again?
      * What happens? Why?
      
      What about this:
      
      ```
      docker run -d -p 80:80 tutum/hello-world
      ```
      
      ---
      # How can you reach your web server?

      # Understanding networking in Docker Toolbox
      
      ![inline](../images/DockerToolboxDiagram.png)
      
      ---
      
      # So which are the commands?
      
      ![inline](../images/DockerToolbox-IP.png)
      
      And now: 
      
      ![inline](../images/DockerToolbox-IP-Tutum.png)
      
      ---
      # Docker images
      
      To get what images you have available use the command:
      
      ```
      docker images
      ```
      - Download a new container from Docker hub and then check the size
      - Are all containers small?
      - Why?
      
      
      ---
      # Build your own Container with a Dockerfile

      A Dockerfile is  a simple textfile that describes a container:
      **FROM**
      * Where to start from (a linux distribution usually) 
      **RUN**
      * Commands to run to customize it (installing packages and/or editing configuration files) 
      **EXPOSE**
      * Network port to use 
      **CMD**
      * What to run **CMD**

      # DockerFile example

      ```
      FROM ubuntu:12.04

      MAINTAINER Kimbro Staken version: 0.1

      ADD ./mysql-setup.sh /tmp/mysql-setup.sh
      RUN /bin/sh /tmp/mysql-setup.sh

      # Adding this will expose mysql on a random host port. It's recommended to avoid this. Other containers on the same
      # host can use the service without it.
      #EXPOSE 3306

      CMD ["/usr/sbin/mysqld"]
      ```

      More options are available: see [here](https://docs.docker.com/)

      # Build a Container from a Dockerfile
      
      You **build** a container from a Dockerfile with a command like:
      
      ```
      docker build -f /path/to/a/Dockerfile .
      ```
      More info [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) 
      
      This will be the topic for the Lab-Docker Advanced Module

      # ADD-ON - Notes for Dell EMC employees only
      **[Thanks to Joseph Heck :) ]**

      If you have a problem when running `docker run` or `docker pull` where it hangs when pulling docker image layers and you are inside the EMC corporate network, it is likely that you are running into SSL certificate errors and trust issues between the Docker daemon and the public Docker Hub/CDN.  For this you must download our SSL certificate and place it inside the container host.
      ---
      
      # For Dell EMC employees only (cont)
      - Open `http://gso.corp.emc.com/installupdatedcerts.aspx` 
      - Download `EMCs SSL Decryption` certificate.
      - Open the file in a text editor and copy the contents
      - Run `docker-machine ssh containerhost` to SSH into the container host
      - Stop Docker by running `sudo /etc/init.d/docker stop`
      
      ---
      
      # For Dell EMC employees only (cont)
      - In the Docker container host, create a new file and copy the `EMC SSL.cer` contents into it by running `vi EMC_SSL.cer`, press `i` to be able to insert text, paste the contents you copied above, then press `:wq` to write the file and quit the text editor
      - Convert the certificate to a PEM file with `openssl x509 -in EMC_SSL.cer -out EMC_SSL.pem`
      - Update the CA certificates files to include this certificate with `cat EMC_SSL.pem | sudo tee -a /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`
      
      ---
       # For Dell EMC employees only (cont)
      - Start the Docker daemon services again with ```sudo /etc/init.d/docker start```
      - Verify that you can still connect to the Docker engine by running `docker version` and then verify that you can download images by doing `docker pull redis`
