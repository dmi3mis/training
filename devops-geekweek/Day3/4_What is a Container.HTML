      #Container vs Images
      * A container is a running application (see the def. above)
      * You create a container using an image. So think of an image like a recipe.
      * You create containers from images

      #What are the benefits of Containers?

      * Solve the "Works On My Machine" problem -> Eliminate environment inconsistencies
      * Make installation VERY simple
      * Allow for delete and upgrade/Easier rollbacks if needed <- NO OS Maintenance
      * Share applications in an easier and faster way
