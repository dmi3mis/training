      # Lab Docker Advanced

      Welcome to your Docker Advanced Lab :)

      In this session you'll be less guided so please free to use and abuse Google searching capabilities ;)

      ---
      # Module Goals
      
      This is what we would like you to achieve:
      * Get sample app from git
      * write dockerfile
      * compile image
      * build swarm cluster
      * push 2 containers to cluster
      * edit app (just changing the html or adding some external microservice)
      * compile
      * redeploy your App again

      ---

      # Example Application

      Here is the application available for you to deploy and edit:

      https://github.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app

      The Application has multiple endpoints:

      * `/`: Display a title, index number for the app, and uptime for the running instance.
      * `/env`: Display a nicely formatted output of the environment variables
      * `/port`: Return the port number the application is listening on
      * `/exit`: Displays a warning message and then forcibly exits the server

      ---

      # Application Details
      
      This is a python application that builds up a web server with a few subpages/endpoints
      
      ---
      # Application Screenshots

      Here is how the app should loook like when deployed:

      `/` endpoint:

      ![index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app/master/images/index.png)

      ---

      `/env` endpoint:

      ![env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app/master/images/env.png)

      # Some Hints
      - Best option is to review the Dockerfile format in the previous module
      - Start up with a base container
      - Figure out what you need to add
      - Remember that networking is important ;)
      - There are **many** other ways to do this
      
      ---
      
      # More hints
      - You'll not need the requirements.txt and manifest.yml files in your container (but you better read them :P )
      - You'll need to copy some folder and files in your container
      - You'll also need to install software from your Container
      - docker logs may help you in troubleshooting

      #Bonus Stage
      
      Build a container that is smaller than the one showed at the previous link
