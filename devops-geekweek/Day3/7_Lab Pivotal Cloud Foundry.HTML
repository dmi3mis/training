      # Lab Pivotal Cloud Foundry
      
      ---

      #Lab Overview

      In this lab activity you'll be using **Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)** to deploy, scale and manage the application that you deployed in the previous Docker Lab

      ---
      
      # Installing PCF Dev

      Please perform PCF Dev Installation following these instructions:

      [PCF Dev Basic Installation](https://my.syncplicity.com/share/2t7rvqo5igl9jd6/PCF%20Dev%20rev%200.3)

      #Lab Overview

      In this session you'll be less guided so please free to use and abuse Google searching capabilities ;)

      This is what we would like you to achieve:
      * Get sample app from git
      * Push it to PCF dev
      * Examine its logs
      * Scale the Application
      * Change the application and redeploy it
      * BONUS: BLUE/GREEN Deployment
      
      ---
      
      #Example Application

      Here is the application available for you to deploy and edit:

      https://github.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app

      The Application has multiple endpoints:

      * `/`: Display a title, index number for the app, and uptime for the running instance.
      * `/env`: Display a nicely formatted output of the environment variables
      * `/port`: Return the port number the application is listening on
      * `/exit`: Displays a warning message and then forcibly exits the server, (hopefully) causing CF to restart the instance
      
      ---
      
      #Application Details

      Here is how the app should loook like when deployed:

      `/` endpoint:

      ![index](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app/master/images/index.png)
      
      ---
      
      `/env` endpoint:

      ![env](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dotnext/cf-sample-app/master/images/env.png)

      ---
      
      #Bonus Stage

      Deploy the Application on PCF but using Docker Containers

      *HINT:* You have some instructions in the PCF dev installation document ;)
