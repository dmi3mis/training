      #Benefits of Microservices
      
      Less code to manage
      Smaller code base -> Smaller teams
      Deployed, upgraded, scaled, and restarted independent of other services in the application
      Automation and testing are easier and faster (less code, less people)
      Parallelization is easier

      #Microservices vs Monoliths
      
      The microservices model is the opposite of traditional monolithic software which consists of tightly integrated modules that ship infrequently and have to scale as a single unit.
