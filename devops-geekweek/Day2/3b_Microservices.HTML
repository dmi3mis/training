      #Microservices

      >"Microservices refers to an architectural approach that independent teams use to prioritize the continuous delivery of single-purpose services. "

      > "A collection of small services where each service implements business capabilities, a microservice runs in its own process and communicates via an HTTP API."

      #Benefits of Microservices
      
      - Less code to manage
      - Smaller code base -> Smaller teams
      - Deployed, upgraded, scaled, and restarted independent of other services in the application
      - Automation and testing are easier and faster (less code, less people)
      - Parallelization is easier

      #Microservices vs Monoliths
      
      The microservices model is *the opposite of traditional monolithic software* which consists of tightly integrated modules that ship infrequently and have to scale as a single unit.
      ---
      
      #What's a Monolith?
      
      - **Tightly coupled** multiple interdependent components that must deployed in a specific order
      - **Many Teams** multiple teams are inovolved in its lifecycle (create, maintain (Ops), evolve)
      - Software **deployments happen at scheduled times** and usually not frequently (quarterly/yearly)
      - The software tries to solve many business problems at once using **tight integrated code**

      #Are you ready for Microservices?
      
      - Identify which applications require frequent  changese *these*are good candidates for micsroservices
      - Automation and continuous delivery must be possible in your organization
      - Team organizations should avoid Technology silos
      - Your Service Discovery, Load Balancing and messaging technologies will **change**
      - You'll be managing **more** servers, services, applications: is your security, automation and configuration management up to the task?
